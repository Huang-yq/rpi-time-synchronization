# Project Timeline

## Hardware Setup and Initial Configuration
*February 28 - March 13*

- Acquire necessary hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, GPS receivers). 
- Set up the GPS Grandmaster on one RPi 5 unit. 
- Set up initial PTP clients on additional RPi 5 units. 
- Ensure basic communication between grandmaster and clients. 
- Baseline performance data collection from RPi5 and CM4, and comparison. 

**Milestone: Hardware set-up completed and initial synchronization established.**

## Basic Techniques Implementation
*March 11 - March 24*

- Implement and test basic techniques: 
	- CPU isolation, process pinning, interrupt steering.
- Document setup and configuration steps!
- Begin prelim performance monitoring and data collection.
- Baseline vs basic technique implementation performance analysis.  

**Milestone: Basic HFT technique setup.**

## Intermediate Techniques Implementation 
*March 25 - April 7*

- Replicate basic technique set up on CM4 (lab) and collect data. 
- Basic techniques CM4 performance data analysis and comparison with RPi5 information.
- Implement and test intermediate techniques: 
	- busy poll detection, code recompilation, caching optimizations
- Continue performance monitoring and adjust configurations as necessary. 
- Continue updating documentation. 

**Milestone: Intermediate HFT techqniues setup.**

## Advanced Techniques and Analysis
*April 8 - April 21*

- Replicate intermediate techniques set up on CM4 and collect data.
- Intermediate techqniues CM4 performance data analysis and comparison with RPi5 information. 
- Implement and test adv techniques: 
	- Thermal regulation, multi-GPS PPS output analysis
- Reeplicate advanced technique implementation on CM4 (as possible) and data collection. 
- Comprehensive data analysis. 

**Milestone: All levels of techniques applied and comprehensive data collected.**

## Final Analysis and Project Wrap-Up 
*April 22 - April 30* 

- Complete detailed statistical analysis of performance changes. 
- Revise final project report including detailed methodology, results, and recommendations. 
- Review and finalize all project documentation. 

**Milestone: Complete project with final report and GitLab Repo.**
