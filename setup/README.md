# Notes

This directory contains scripts to configure two Raspberry Pi 5 units as PTP GPS Grandmaster and Client systems. It requires the use of a u-blox LEA-5T-0-003 GPS receiver or another GPS receiver capable of transmitting PPS and GPS signals via UART.

Please see subdirectories for more detailed information and individual script documentation.
